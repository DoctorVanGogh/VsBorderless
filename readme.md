# Simple mod for Vintage Story

Turns "maximized" windowed mode into borderless fullscreen (on the screen the window was maximized on). 

Note: Will remain as normal maximized until you connect to a server.

To disable the borderless windowed mode toggle "fullscreen" twice, tha tshould get you back to a window (albeit it might still be a bit front-sticky).
